            <p>
              P.R.Govindarajan, Founder of Humour Club, introduced him to film director K.Balachandar for the first time and began a professional relationship as a script-writer for the director's films.

            <p>
            Balachandar became closer to Vivek. While assisting with the script for Manathil Uruthi Vendum in 1987, Balachandar offerd Vivek an acting role of Suhasini's brother in the film, which he decided to pursue.

            <p>He began his career portraying supporting roles</p>
            <p>
              He collaborated again with Balachandar in Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal (1989) and Oru Veedu Iru Vasal (1990), before often appearing in the primary cast as a friend to the film's lead actor in films such as K.S. Ravikumar's Putham Pudhu Payanam (1991) and Vikraman's Naan Pesa Ninaipathellam (1993).
              He then also made appearances in Rajinikanth's Uzhaippali and Veera, playing secondary cast roles.

          <h3 class="brief-title">Breakthrough and Success</h3>
          <div class="brief-item">
            <p>
              Vivek had to wait till 1996 to establish himself as a sole comedian who could help carry the film, and thereafter began to appear in increasingly prominent roles in his ventures.
              In the late 1990s, Vivek was able to make a breakthrough by appearing as the lead comedian in films, who would often be the main friend of the lead actor and thus his on-screen time began to increase. He worked consecutively on successful films starring Ajith Kumar, appearing as a sidekick in Kaadhal Mannan, Unnai Thedi and Vaali, and had similar success repeatedly featuring alongside Prashanth in Kannedhirey Thondrinal, Poomagal Oorvalam and Aasaiyil Oru Kaditham.
              He subsequently became amongst the most busy actors in 2000 and 2001, featuring in over fifty films in two years. Films including Kushi, Priyamanavale and Minnale became blockbusters, while his roles in Mani Ratnam's Alaipayuthey, Mugavaree and Dumm Dumm Dumm all won critical acclaim for the actor. The rising success of Vivek's films had meant that he was featured on film posters on an equivalent scale to the lead actor, and thus helped stuck films find distributors.
              Telugu films were dubbed into Tamil and released with an additional comedy track featuring the actor such as Kanden Seethaiyai, while devotional films Kottai Mariamman, Palayathu Amman and Nageswari were released with a separate comedy track featuring Vivek.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="brief-item">
            <p>
              He played extended comedy roles in Vikram's Dhool and Priyadarshan's Lesa Lesa, while winning further acclaim for his portrayal of a teacher in Saamy and a software engineer in Parthiban Kanavu. He then played a marginally more serious role in S.Shankar's coming-of-age tale Boys, portraying a mentor to the group of youngsters, and his performance was well received.
              Success continued in 2004, where he retained the Filmfare Award for Best Comedian for his role of a marriage assembler in Perazhagan, while his roles in Chellamae and M.Kumaran Son of Mahalakshmi helped contribute to the films' commercial success respectively.
              He also made a special exception to appear in a few artistic films and often charged significantly less remuneration for the ventures, notably playing character roles in Janaki Vishwanathan's Kutty (2001) and Thangar Bachan's Azhagi (2002). In the later film, the director had requested Vivek to write and appear in a role himself, in order to use his fame to help the film find a distributor for release.
              In mid 2004, he suffered an injury during the production of a film and took a break from acting assignments for a period of six months.Vivek returned by portraying a well-received supporting role in Shankar's Anniyan (2005), appearing as an undercover police officer hunting down clues left by a psychopath serial killer. The film opened to critical and commercial success with a critic noting "Vivek's comedy is bankable", and the actor subsequently went on to win the State Award for Best Comedian for his work on the venture.
              He continued his comeback with appearances in Vijay's Aathi, Ajith Kumar's Paramasivan and Silambarasan's Saravana, all of which released on the same day in January 2006. After winning acclaim for his performance as a comedic undercover detective in Susi Ganesan's Thiruttu Payale, Shankar approached him to feature in a prominent role in his venture Sivaji (2007), starring Rajinikanth, which would go on to become the most expensive Tamil film made at release.
              Vivek allotted ninety days for the film, significantly more than any of his previous films, and his performance as Rajinikanth's sidekick Arivu won him another award from the state for Best Comedian. He won positive reviews from critics for his performance, with reviewers noting his "one-liners are really whacky and hilarious" and that "Vivek must come in for special mention for his performance".
              Through his career, he had acted in over 220 films.
